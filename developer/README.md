Documentation First
-------------------
Any new feature or APIs changing should finish its document,
so that others can confirm that it is suitable.
But dob't worry, most of them will pass.

All documentation are store in `elearn-doc`.
Make pull request to propose the change.

Please add the new feature to `propose` directionary and wait for moving to `accepted` directionary.
For APIs, direct change the API, the pull request accepted meaning that the change is accepted.

Pull request changing feature and APIs but without propose would **not be accepted**.
