#Nginx

[Site](http://nginx.org/en)

Nginx is a web server with a strong focus on high concurrency,
performance and low memory usage.
It can also act as a reverse proxy server
for HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP3, and IMAP protocols,
as well as a load balancer and an HTTP cache.

nginx is built and installed in `/usr/local/nginx`.
The one installed `apt` is no longer been used.
`nginx` can be called in global.
