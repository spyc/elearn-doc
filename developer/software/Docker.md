#Docker

[Site](https://www.docker.com/)

Docker is an open-source project
that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers,
by providing an additional layer of abstraction
and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Linux.
Docker uses resource isolation features of the Linux kernel
such as cgroups and kernel namespaces to allow independent "containers"
to run within a single Linux instance,
avoiding the overhead of starting
and maintaining virtual machines.

Docker is installed by `apt`, with version 1.9.0 build 76d6bc9.
