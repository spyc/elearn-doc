#SBT

[Site](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)

SBT is an open source build tool for Scala and Java projects,
similar to Java's Maven or Ant.

Its main features are:
- native support for compiling Scala code and integrating with many Scala test frameworks
- build descriptions written in Scala using a DSL
- dependency management using Ivy (which supports Maven-format repositories)
- continuous compilation, testing, and deployment
- integration with the Scala interpreter for rapid iteration and debugging
- support for mixed Java/Scala projects

SBT is provided in global.
For global, sbt can be started by `/usr/local/bin/sbt`.
