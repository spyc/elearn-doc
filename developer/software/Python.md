#Python

[API](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/)

Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability,
and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code
than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java.

Both Python 2.7.6 and 3.4.0 are provided for command lines.
Python 3.4.0 is used for providing external services.
