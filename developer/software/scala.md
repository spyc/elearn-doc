Scala is a programming language for general software applications.
Scala has full support for functional programming and
a very strong static type system.
This allows programs written in Scala to be very concise and
thus smaller in size than other general-purpose programming languages.
Many of Scala's design decisions were inspired
by criticism of the shortcomings of Java.

Scala is run on JVM.
Therefore, the JDK is required.
The scala is downloaded and installed in `/usr/local/scala`.
The current scala version is 2.11.7.
