#Express.js

[Site](http://expressjs.org/)

Express.js is a Node.js web application server framework,
designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications.
It is the de facto standard server framework for node.js.
The original author, TJ Holowaychuck, described it as a Sinatra-inspired server,
meaning that it is relatively minimal with many features available as plugins.

express is installed by `npm install -g express`.
It is used in light-weight service.
